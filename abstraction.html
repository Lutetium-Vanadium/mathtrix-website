            Mathematics is the purest of the arts, as well as the most

          Through Abstraction we hope to do justice to this fallen art. This
          event draws inspiration from the worlds of logic and creativity and
          seeks to explore the realm of mathematical art. Artistic skill and
          problem-solving abilities are prime characteristics to help
          participants in this innovative event. Abstraction welcomes artists to
          transform art pieces like The Starry Night, The Last Supper or the
          ceiling of the Sistine Chapel or create their own to express
          themselves. Artists are welcome to test their creativity and solve
          problems to create a masterpiece!

          <h3>Rules</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              Each team must consist of two participants - one artist and one
              question solver (preferably aware of 12th math).
            </li>
            <li>This event has only one round.</li>
            <li>
              The question solver unlocks rgb codes of colours by answering some
              questions.
            </li>
            <li>
              The artist must make an abstract piece depicting given math topics
              while using colours unlocked by the question solver only.
            </li>
            <li>
              The final piece to be submitted along with a 50 word write up
              explaining the art piece. Answers to the questions asked in
              relation to the RGB codes must also be submitted.
